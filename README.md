# Automated-Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
investigates automated pneumonia detection through deep learning methodologies, implementing and comparing three distinct convolutional neural network architectures. Utilizing a dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images, we evaluated custom CNN architecture alongside VGG16 and ResNet50 transfer learning models.
